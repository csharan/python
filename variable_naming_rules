Variable Naming Rules
Introduction
Variable names are subject to certain restrictions in Python. Keep the following rules in mind as you write your own programs.



Variable Naming Rules
No spaces are allowed.

The first character must be a letter (lowercase or uppercase) or an underscore.

Only letters, numbers and underscores are permitted after the first character.

Variable names are case-sensitive. ​name​ and ​Name​ are two distinct, separate variables.

Variable names should describe the data that they are referencing.

Use underscores to separate multiple words. This is called snake case style because the text resembles a snake.

Example: my_favorite_flavor_of_ice_cream
